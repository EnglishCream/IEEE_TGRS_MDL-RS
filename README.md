___________

The code in this toolbox implements the ["More Diverse Means Better: Multimodal Deep Learning Meets Remote Sensing Imagery Classification"](Coming Soon!). More specifically, it is detailed as follow.

## Citation

**Please kindly cite the papers if this code is useful and helpful for your research.**

## System-specific notes

The code was tested using [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) in Python 3.7 on Windows 10 machines.

## How to use it?

Coming soon!

Note that the required HSI and LiDAR data can be downloaded either from

1. [drive.google](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17uroC22RdpVSgF2LtsjyMXfPVLw7fMPI/view?usp=sharing)

2. [pan.baidu](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1jddCuQqIeO3CrNnBiK-Q0Q) with access code: `232c`.

:exclamation: You may need to manually download `HSI_TeSet.mat` and `HSI_TrSet.mat` located under `IEEE_TGRS_MDL-RS/MDL-RS_CNNs/HSI_LiDAR_CNN/` due to the large file restrction.

If you want to run the code in your own data, you can accordingly change the input (e.g., data, labels) and tune the parameters.

If you encounter the bugs while using this code, please do not hesitate to contact us.
